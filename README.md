# Website-Style-Guide
Created for the Codecademy Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System in the Web Development Foundations section of the Full-Stack Engineer Certification track.

## Note:
* 5/8/25 - Will potentially add style guides for buttons, positioning, making it responsive, sectioning off related content into their own tabs, etc once I learn from future sections.
